        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            As an IC4 Software Engineer at Nubank, I play a pivotal role in executing independent tasks, particularly in scenarios lacking full specification. I am directly responsible for project delivery, working closely with my manager and teammates, thereby significantly impacting team operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            My contributions are highly regarded for my proficiency in developing and enhancing efficient workflows. I possess expertise in a range of technologies, including ClojureScript, REPL, IntelliJ, and the HTTP BFF (Backend for Frontend) architecture. Leveraging AWS services, I optimize our infrastructure and deployment processes to ensure scalability and reliability. Additionally, I utilize Miro Discoverys to facilitate collaborative discovery sessions and foster innovation within the team.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the "new accounts renew phase," I conduct flow tests, meticulously ensuring the integrity and efficiency of our processes. Furthermore, I am tasked with rewriting playbooks, refining procedures, and communicating delivery milestones effectively to stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a comprehensive understanding of the Kubernetes ecosystem, I manage and scale our services to guarantee optimal performance. I am adept at writing clear and concise code, consistently prioritizing quality and consistency across all deliverables. My ability to debug and resolve complex issues, particularly in production environments, is well-regarded within the team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deeply familiar with Nubank's domain model and business context, I actively contribute to operational responsibilities, including on-call rotations, and collaborate on playbook creation and maintenance to uphold system stability and security.
        </p>
        <p>
            My skill set encompasses a breadth of technologies, including ClojureScript, REPL, IntelliJ, HTTP BFF architecture, AWS services, Miro Discoverys, Kubernetes, among others. I am committed to applying software engineering principles in my daily work, continuously striving to enhance our processes and drive innovation across the entire Nubank team.
